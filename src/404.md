## Go back [home](/)?

While you're here, here's how you got here:

You wanted `/foo`. AWS CloudFront looked at the S3 bucket origin for `foo.html`,
and found nothing. So it returned an ugly `403`. Instead, I use a custom error
response on the CloudFront distribution that returns this page.

```hcl
# cloudfront.tf
resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "this" {
  # [...]
  custom_error_response {
    error_code         = 403
    response_code      = 404
    response_page_path = "/404.html"
  }
}
```
