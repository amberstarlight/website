Hi! I'm Amber ([she/her](https://en.pronouns.page/she)), I'm {{
meta.data.authorAge }}, and I'm a software & operations engineer by trade. My
job title is "DevOps Engineer". In my spare time, I'm an _everything hobbyist_,
weaving in and out of many different interests, including but not limited to:

- cars (incl. sportscar racing, the modified scene, etc)
- computers, namely SFF Linux machines (I use Arch BTW)
- video games, mostly of the late 1990s/early 2000s but also including modern
  motorsport and vehicle simulations
- music, notably drum and bass, jungle, og dubstep, garage, 2step, etc.
- programming, as a hobby
- mechanical keyboards (I write this on a self-designed 1-of-1 _'Vision
  Computer Systems 750 GT'_)
- computer aided design (CAD), electronic engineering (EE), and other 'maker'
  hobbies
- film photography, 35mm and 645 medium format

If you're interested in what I output in a programming sense, I have a profile
on some Git-as-a-Service platforms, which you can see here:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/amberstarlight)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/amberstarlight)

As I work for a contractor, sometimes I am required to use VCS accounts that
are not my own, and this activity is not reflected in any gamification metrics
you see on these platforms. I have a long-running love/hate relationship with
those kind of metrics and I may turn off the commit history as it prioritises
number of commits (and many teams prefer to squash commits so you only get +1
anyway...)

If you want to contact me, you can do so via [email][1].

> Author's note: I am NOT on any Internet platforms not listed on this page.
> Anyone under the username `amberstarlight` on those platforms is an impostor.
