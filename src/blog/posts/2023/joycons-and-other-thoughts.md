I own a Switch, but I don't have Joy-Con drift. Probably because mine hasn't been
used all that often; I actually prefer playing what are these days called 'retro'
games. I've a handful of different systems, however I have almost all the so-called
'Sixth Generation' consoles - that is: the Nintendo GameCube, Microsoft's _Xbox_,
and Sony's PlayStation 2. I own the games I buy for these systems, the discs cannot
be taken from me and corporations and/or IP holders cannot remove my ability to
play them. If you're a 'retro gamer' you've heard it all before.

Ok, yes, that's a _bit_ of a stretch given that Xbox Live was killed in 2010
(remember [the Noble 14][0]!) but we have always had [XLink Kai][1] and other LAN
tunnelling software. If you have an Xbox (that hasn't been destroyed by it's clock
capacitor), you can also now use [Insignia][2] to get _true_ Xbox Live 1.0 (with
the caveat that not all games are yet supported) and relive the real beginnings
of online multiplayer.

So, despite not having Joy-Con drift, I bought a set _with_ it to try out the GuiliKit
[hall-effect analogue sticks][3]. I'm not going to talk about drift in any detail,
because that's been done to death and I can't believe we're still talking about
this in 2023. If you know anything about this problem you probably know that SEGA
actually got ahead of it in the 1990s by using hall-effect sensing in the Saturn
and of course again in the Dreamcast. As an aside: I don't (yet!) have a Dreamcast,
but I am hoping to obtain one in the near future before they become completely
unobtanium. Yeah, they made over 9 million of them, but given the inevitable march
of time it'll just get harder and more expensive to get a nice one.

With a set of Joy-Cons due for analogue stick replacement I also wanted to customise
them a bit. Remember the days of the Xbox 360 where you could buy those 9mm bullet
face buttons? The shotgun shell d-pad? Custom controllers are really an artform,
and I wanted to relive those glory days of modding a bit. I bought joy-con shells
from eXtremeRate, mostly because unlike a lot of other Chinese companies selling
replacement parts for consoles and handhelds, they are actually good at injection
moulding and ensuring good fit and tolerances. In the Game Boy scene, they're
pretty much the best shot you have at a good third-party shell that isn't going
full DIY and getting into resin-casting from OEM parts. Oh, and you can even still
buy those dorky bullet shell buttons for your Xbox.

This led me to a little bit of a conundrum. You see, I've always wondered why the
Switch doesn't have a d-pad. Nintendo basically made it a standard (even though
they have a stupid name for it, 'Control Pad'). The Switch Pro controller has one.
Every Nintendo game console and handheld since the 6502-era has one. The Virtual
Boy had _two_. HORI made a Joy-Con with one. Nintendo even put one on the Switch
Lite, in what is basically an admission that _The Nintendo Switch Should Have
Had A D-Pad_. So why doesn't it? My partner tells me that this is because of
the 2 and 4-player modes where each player gets one joy-con to use; this way
both players get one analogue stick and 4 face buttons alongside the 'shoulder'
buttons (SL/SR) and nobody is disadvantaged. There's a symmetry.

[It's like poetry. They rhyme.][4]

But that doesn't cut it for me ergonomically; I bought the [d-pad shell][5]
from eXtremeRate. It's a really good design, all told. Not least because they've
again shown off their fantastic part replication and injection moulding finesse,
but also because their designers and engineers have put a d-pad into a controller
which didn't originally have one, without needing you to make any changes other
than installing the new shell. It uses the same membrane as the face buttons,
which conspicuously is just one piece. The d-pad is beautifully ergonomic; your
thumb sits neatly in the centre and glides across the smooth plastic to reach
the edges, which you can feel as the point of contact your thumb feels becomes
smaller. You can rotate around the d-pad with so much less effort than the 4
face buttons. Quarter circle forward (or QCF, or 236, or whatever the [FGC][6] calls
it this week) is a breeze. I don't have any fighting games for the Switch, so I
don't even know if games support diagonals on the Switch (but surely they must?)
but the d-pad makes this vastly easier. And to add to that; it just looks _right_
on the Switch. It's like it was _always meant to be there_!

As for the hall-effect analogue sticks; they are tight, responsive, and the click
is sharp and well-defined. Comparatively, the original [Hosiden-Nintendo][7] part
(no, it _wasn't_ designed by Satan himself, or Alps Alpine {formerly Alps Electric}
who make just about every analogue stick ever under their ThumbPointer&trade; series)
feels vague and uninspired. And due to their hall-effect sensing, the GuiliKit
sticks are an _objective upgrade_ for your Switch Joy-Cons. Their expected lifetime
is going to be far, far longer than the carbon-film resistive sense units. And
according to GuiliKit, they actually use about half of the power (160uA vs. 390uA)
so should give your Joy-Cons a little extra battery life. What's not to like?

It's really, really not difficult to replace the analogue sticks. Watch a video
or read a guide online and _you **can** do it_. Just be gentle with the flex cables
in there, okay? It was more difficult to replace the entire shell of my Joy-Cons
than it was to _just_ do the analogue sticks. If you own a Switch, you _can_ fix
Nintendo's mistakes. The importance of [right-to-repair][8] cannot be understated
here.

The point that I'm getting at here is, to spell it out plainly, why can't these
big companies actually create products without such stupid and obvious flaws?
Yes, we have the benefit of hindsight, but these corporations should (being the
key word here) be full of various engineers that should (there's that word again)
know better! At the least; it allows small businesses to fill the gap and provide
us hobbyists with the means to fix and improve the things we buy; because it's 2023
and all products are terrible. Why don't they make things like they used to?
Because planned obsolescence makes companies more money, and that's all they
care about. Don't let companies fool you into believing [they have values][9].
