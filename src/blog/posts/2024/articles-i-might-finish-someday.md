The last article I wrote on this blog was on the 6th of March. I hadn't updated
my [now](/now) page since late May. In the months since these posts, I've been
deep into the throes of Real Life (that is, the offline world of flesh and blood
and sweat and tears). I moved house - over a hundred miles from my childhood
home, I became friends with so many new likeminded people, interpersonal
relationships ebbed and flowed, I've been in and out of hospital for friends
and friends' relatives, I attended a funeral, I got my first tattoo, and my
car dumped various fluids all over the tarmac (I spent `several money` getting
him fixed).

Alongside this, I've been coming to terms with my (as of yet undiagnosed)
ADHD and autism, which has led to a lot of self-reflection in the form of
journalling, which can be helpful if I remember to do it. Routines are really
helpful for my autism, but my ADHD knows that routines are boring, and so tends
to give me a healthy dose of executive dysfunction when I go to do parts of a
routine. This includes writing about things for my blog, which has gone somewhat
neglected in the interim. (Part of that, I feel, is that I should be less serious
with my personal website - I do think there's an amount of self-censoring that
can happen when Posting; [employers][g-man] tend to have social media policies,
and it's been known that potential employers will scour any OSINT they can find
on a potential hire during the interview process.)

In my note-taking app of choice ([Joplin][joplin], which I quite like as a
no-fuss _I just need to write Markdown_ app) I have several draft posts that I
had intended to write and post on this site, but have since stalled for various
reasons. Amongst them are some that I think I'll finish some day:

1. ## Peak Car is Long Gone

   In which I theorise how the peak _Enthusiast's Car_ is always 20 years
   old, how car companies have pivoted to being technology companies as making
   An Car is a solved problem, and that we might have already seen the last
   _Enthusiast's Car_.

2. ## All Killer, No Filler

   In which I out myself as a "they don't make 'em like they used to" gamer and
   discuss the lost art of _video game menus_ and _artstyle consistency_.

3. ## untitled post about societal progress

   In which I discuss how I have personally seen societal progress happen, but
   that we don't notice it in the moment until we look back and say "why did we
   ever do things that way".

4. ## B-Sides

   In which I talk about the lost art that is the _B-side_, the death and
   resurgence of physical media, and what it's like to be _present_ in a
   moment.

5. ## untitled post about how i got into tech

   In which I explain how using Discord and writing a [bot][discord] helped
   me land me a job as a software engineer, by starting my journey into Linux
   administration and programming.

I can't quite work out which one to tackle first. If you know me, or want to
read one of these unfinished articles, please drop me a message and request it -
that should give me more impetus to finish it.
