Ever since I first read Noah Smith's [_Honestly, it's probably the phones_][0],
I've been unable to stop the feeling that there's a link between Internet use
(namely via the ubiquity of the smartphone) and poor mental health indicators.
And I don't think I'm the only one; for a few years now Gen Z has been shunning
the most modern technology, preferring [older digital cameras][1], dedicated
music players like iPods, and even feature phones (or as they are commonly
called now, [dumb phones][2]). You may have seen it written that [_"the internet
used to be a place"_][3], and whilst it's becoming trite to read that phrase,
it's true! Talk to the millennials and the eldest Gen Z you know and ask them
about the _computer room_. My family had one and, I'd wager, quite a lot of
families still do have one - but it's now "the office" or "the place I work
from home".

For some, "the computer room" was just "the family computer"; a wooden desk
with a beige pizza box or tower PC and a crisp CRT (and later, a chunky 4:3 LCD
panel) in the corner of another room, such as the dining room or living room.
It was in a place where your Internet use could be seen over your shoulder - you
knew that at any time a parent, guardian, or sibling could walk in and
ask "what are you looking at?". Things like edutainment games, Wikipedia, or
research websites were good - and things like adult-oriented games, crass/loud
videos, and pornography were not. "Mum said it's my turn on the Xbox" might be a
meme these days, but when the family had one computer between them, time on the
Internet was restricted. That includes the time it took for your machine to boot
to desktop!

Come back to the present for a moment. Where do you go to access the Internet
now, in 2026? It might be a more revealing question if I asked, "where _haven't_
you accessed the Internet in 2026?" You do it in supermarkets when looking at
recipes online to see what ingredients you need. You do it in a coffee shop to
reply to a group chat. You do it because you responded to that notification, and
your muscle memory opened another app. You even do it mindlessly while walking
along the street or sat on the toilet, because you've become accustomed to never
having to be bored ever again. At what point does it become an addiction?

Luckily, you can set app timers on all your social media through Digital
Wellbeing or Screen Time. Is 15 minutes a day per app enough? What about
uninstalling the apps from your phone? Can you put it in another room during
the day, or leave it behind when you go outside? How does it feel to think about
doing that? Did it make you anxious, or does it feel like a relief? What kinds
of thoughts does using your phone let you avoid?

There are several different problems at play with the way that most people now
access the Internet. In no particular order:

- We can access the Internet at any time, in almost any place, and with little
  to no restrictions.

- There are little to no social repercussions from accessing the Internet in
  this way, even when avoiding others in public spaces. (This, apparently, is
  called "phubbing".)

- Infinite-scroll or endless-scroll user interfaces encourage addiction
  by continually feeding users stimulus without any defined breakpoints
  (stopping cues), by design, to increase KPIs such as user retention time and
  advertiser/platform revenue. You're no longer making a choice on platforms like
  this; you're just still there.

- Social media platforms and 'for you' style content discovery algorithms
  surface divisive and emotionally manipulative content, as it drives engagement
  and thus revenue.

- The _Fear Of Missing Out_ (FOMO) is greatly boosted by our always-connected
  lifestyles.

- We are bombarded with an onslaught of information from the 24/7 news cycle
  that desensitises us to violence.

- The assumption that everyone will be carrying a modern smartphone has led
  to companies prioritising connection, and dropping non-connected services.
  This is referred to by a number of names, such as digital exclusion or digital
  disadvantage.

There are of course many different kinds of 'online harms', typically those
that are spoken about in the same sentences as 'protect children', such
as (extreme) pornography, terrorist or extremist content, 'pro-suicide'
websites, disinformation, etc. However, in my opinion the largest-scale harms
are done not by age-inappropriate content in and of itself, but by the use
of centralised social media platforms and excessive screen time caused by
_the-whole-Internet-in-your-pocket_ devices. The more screen time you have in
a day, the higher the chance you will expose yourself to these harms; the Molly
Rose Foundation [reports that][4] "teens aged 13-17 were being algorithmically
recommended potentially harmful content at deeply worrying levels".

A recent article in The Times is titled [_Some primary school pupils ‘can swipe
a screen but can’t speak’_][5] and features a number of shocking paragraphs
about some of the impacts that unfettered Internet access is having on young
children. Whether this is a global trend or not is yet to be proven, but in the
age of [Adolescence][6] and [Andrew Tate][7] this is a deeply worrying study.
Of course, this doesn't tell the full story of _why_ this is happening, to
which the answer probably lies somewhere in "parents don't have enough time to
care for their children because the cost of living is too great to work part
time". Many millennials will claim that they (like I did!) have either fairly
or completely unrestricted Internet access, and that they "turned out alright",
but the Internet and indeed society is such a different beast to when we were
younger.

I believe that the primary accelerator of this is to do with convergence; over
the past 30 years, this technological convergence has almost completely erased
the friction that media consumption used to have. If you wanted to watch a
movie, you had to go to the cinema or rent a video from Blockbuster. To listen
to music, you put on a cassette or CD. If you wanted to watch the next episode
of a TV show, you had to wait until next week. To get news, you bought a
newspaper or caught up with bulletins on TV at different points throughout the
day. In 2026 we are coming up to over a decade of being able to do all of these
things on a smartphone within seconds of each other, and you can do it from
anywhere you like, for as long as you like, given you have a Wi-Fi connection
or mobile data signal and enough battery. This convergence has fundamentally
changed the way that we engage with media and art.

It's not just our relationship with media that has changed. We're now expected
to be available and respond to messages within minutes - as group chat software
made the jump from IRC to apps. WhatsApp, which shows read receipts, has
completely overtaken SMS (which doesn't). Discord is the communication tool of
choice for a whole generation. When was the last time you called your friends,
using the phone part of your phone - and left a voicemail if they didn't pick
up? Of course there are many benefits to asynchronous communication but it's
a completely different experience; think of how many long email chains leave
people irritated, and how phone calls to customer service (hopefully) lead to
getting your problem solved - the warmth of hearing someone's voice in real time
cannot be underestimated.

## Breaking the cycle

This argument is not one of "convenience is bad", but rather that an excess
of convenience breaks down important psychological walls that would otherwise
prevent us from spending too long using something. And in this case, it is
this convenience that the smartphone allows that funnels people into either
doomscrolling, seeing unwanted or traumatic content, or being manipulated by
bad actors (state backed or not) who want to shape public opinion through social
media networks.

I see a possible way out; make the Internet a place again! By having spaces
where the Internet _is_ and having to leave them to engage with the world, we
stand to be more present in our lives and with each other. That could look like
any number of things, for example:

- Leaving your smartphone in one room of the house, meaning you have to go there
  to use the Internet.
- Replacing your smartphone with a "dumb phone".
- Not having Wi-Fi at all; forcing the internet to become tethered again.

There are also other things I would suggest doing, regardless of what you do
with your smartphone:

- Stop using big social media platforms; they are psychologically designed to
  make you addicted (and to [feed on your strongest emotions][8]). Block them
  at your router/firewall level if you have to.

- Have honest conversations with the people you know who struggle not to be on
  the Internet.

- Make time in your week to be completely disconnected from the Internet; be
  present with your thoughts and those around you.
