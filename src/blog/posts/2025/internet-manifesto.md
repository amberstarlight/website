When I published my [first blog post](/blog/i-made-a-website) on this
website, 955 days ago, I eluded to some of the reasons why I chose to do so;
it had only been a few months since Elon Musk had purchased Twitter ([see
for yourself how that's going][twt]), Cory Doctorow had coined the term
'[enshittification][cory]', and (though I didn't mention it at the time) the
initial version of OpenAI's _ChatGPT_ was released to the public.

In the interim 31 months, a lot has happened to the internet. Many more
people claim to believe in some version of the Dead Internet Theory, using
examples such as SEO/keyword stuffing, AI-generated content, and interactions
(unknowingly or not) with bot users as evidence. In the United States, TikTok
[was banned][tiktok] (and then it wasn't). In the United Kingdom, the _Online
Safety Act_, a piece of legislation aimed at protecting children from 'harmful
content', entered a new phase of its rollout; big tech implemented age-gating
for UK users, often [overzealously][osa]. Imgur [pulled out of the UK][imgur]
after the ICO signalled that the parent company MediaLab would be fined for
failures to protect the data of children. Australians under the age of 16
now [cannot use big social media platforms][aus]. Cloudflare had [multiple
outages][cloudflare] that took many websites across the Internet with it. The
tech sector rumbles with a quiet fear of a catastrophic implosion of the [AI
bubble][zitron].

The Internet continues to be an ever-changing landscape, and many of these news
stories made me come back to the IndieWeb as a place of stability outside of the
corporate web. Personal websites, especially those that don't meet the criteria
of new legislation, are isolated from a lot of the big happenings of the last
couple of years. To this end, I have decided to codify some of my principles for
my website.

## Principles

1. [Let's Share What We Know][0]

   I believe the world wide web should be users-first. It should be for sharing,
   for documenting, and for _people_. I write blog posts and document my hobbies
   and processes in the hope that by sharing what I know, other people will
   share what they know - for the benefit of the whole community.

2. [I Fight For The Users][1]

   I choose to **respect the user**. End-users should be able to access the
   content they have asked for, and nothing they have not, in a way that best
   meets their needs.

   ### I do

   - my best to keep this website lightweight
   - provide the source code for this website, under a copyleft licence
   - allow the use of all article text under a creative commons licence
   - my best to make this website accessible

   ### I do not

   - serve advertising
   - track users
   - use content suggestion algorithms
   - use deceptive/dark patterns
   - use cookies

3. [A Computer Can Never Be Held Accountable][2]

   No generative AI is used in the making of this website. I invite you to think
   about the following questions in the context of AI-generated material:
   - Why didn't a human want to create this content? If it wasn't worth spending
     time creating it, is it worth spending time consuming it?

   - Is the amount of energy and water use worth the output of this technology,
     given the ongoing climate crisis?

   - Which people/groups do you see pushing for the use of this technology, and
     how do they stand to benefit from it? Who stands to lose?

   - Was the model's training data acquired legally, from public domain or
     appropriately licensed works? How can you tell?

   - Is the generated output accurate, and is source data cited? If not, why
     not?

## Final thoughts

This is a list that I can see myself revisiting from time to time. Like
many parts of the Internet that I remember fondly, consider it [under
construction][construction] and subject to change.

I intend to write a longer piece about the legislation that is changing the way
that we interact with the Internet and Big Tech platforms, exploring the laws
and the intentions behind them - but also inviting thought about the societal
shift that the Internet has created.

I would encourage you, the reader, to explore the [IndieWeb][iwc]. I would also
encourage you to think about the ways in which you engage with the Internet -
and other people on the Internet. Making the Internet a nicer place to be starts
with the ways in which you treat others online; chasing likes and followers
might give you lots of dopamine, but making real and meaningful connections and
simply being nice to others is healthier for you and your online community.
