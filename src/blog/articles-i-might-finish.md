The last article I wrote on this blog was on the 6th of March. I hadn't updated
my now page since late May. In the months since these posts, I've been deep
into the throes of Real Life (that is, the offline world of flesh and blood and
sweat and tears). I moved house - over a hundred miles from my childhood home,
I became friends with so many new likeminded people, interpersonal relationships
ebbed and flowed, I've been in and out of hospital for friends and friends'
relatives, I attended a funeral, I got my first tattoo, and my car dumped
various fluids all over the tarmac (I spent `several money` getting him fixed).

In my note-taking app of choice ([Joplin][joplin], which I quite like as a
no-fuss _I just need to write Markdown_ app) I have several draft posts that I
had intended to write and post on this site, but have since stalled for various
reasons. Amongst them are some that I think I'll finish some day:

- **Peak Car Is Long Gone**
  - In which I theorise how the peak _Enthusiast's Car_ is always 20 years old,
    how car companies have pivoted to being technology companies as making An Car
    is a solved problem, and that we might have already seen the last _Enthusiast's
    Car_.
- **All Killer, No Filler**
  - In which I out myself as a "they don't make 'em like they used to" gamer and
    discuss the lost art of _video game menus_ and _artstyle consistency_.
- **Untitled Post About Societal Progress**
  - In which I discuss how I have personally seen societal progress happen, but
    that we don't notice it in the moment until we look back and say "why did we
    ever do things that way".
- **B-Sides**
  - In which I talk about the lost art that is the _B-side_, the death and
    resurgence of physical media
- **Untitled Post About How I Got Into Tech**
  - In which I explain how using Discord and writing a bot helped me land me a job
    as a software engineer.
