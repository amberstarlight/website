### Work

I'm a DevOps Engineer at <https://transformuk.com/>. That means I make the stuff
that websites, applications, and other software runs on in _~the cloud~_, and
how it gets built and deployed.

### Interests

Currently, my biggest interest is film photography. I shoot 35mm film with a
Pentax MX, just like your dad used to. My favourite film stocks are currently
Ilford HP5 Plus and Kodak Gold 200. _If I could afford Portra, it would displace
Gold._

I'm also one half of _Cutie Club_, a project between my partner and I, where
we do small-scale electronic engineering, PCB design, and other open source
hardware projects.

I've been detaching myself from technology in my spare time (partly why I'm
specifically an _analogue_ photographer) and I've found my mental health
improved. [Touch some grass today][1].

I don't use social media. If you want to contact me, you can do so via
[email][2].
