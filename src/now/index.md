Last update: {% niceDate page.date %}

This is a [now page][1], which I'll update to give you an overview of what I'm
doing _Now_. Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff)!

## Work

I'm a DevOps Engineer at <https://transformuk.com/>. That means I make the stuff
that websites, applications, and other software runs on in _~the cloud~_, and
how it gets built and deployed.

## Interests

Currently, my biggest interest is film photography. I shoot 35mm film with a
Pentax MX, just like your dad used to. My favourite film stocks are currently
Ilford HP5 Plus (a black and white staple!) and Kodak Gold 200.

I'm also one half of _Cutie Club_, a project between my partner and I, where we
do small-scale electronic engineering, PCB design, and other open source hardware
projects.

I've been detaching myself from technology in my spare time (partly why I'm
specifically an _analogue_ photographer) and I've found my mental health improved.

## Reading

In no particular order, the last few books I've read:

- _The Design of Everyday Things_ by Donald Norman
- _The Transgender Issue_ by Shon Faye
- _Uncomfortable Labels_ by Laura Kate Dale
- _Trans Britain_ by Christine Burns
