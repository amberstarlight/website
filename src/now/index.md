## Now Now Now

This is a [now page][1], which I'll update to give you an overview of what I'm
doing *Now*. Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff)!

### Work

I'm a DevOps Engineer at <https://transformuk.com/>. That means I make the stuff
that websites, applications, and other software runs on in *~the cloud~*, and
how it gets built and deployed.

### Interests

Currently, my biggest interest is film photography. I shoot 35mm film with a
Pentax MX, just like your dad used to. My favourite film stocks are currently
Ilford HP5 Plus and Kodak Gold 200. *If I could afford Portra, it would displace
Gold.*

I'm also one half of *Cutie Club*, a project between my partner and I, where we
do small-scale electronic engineering, PCB design, and other open source hardware
projects.

I've been detaching myself from technology in my spare time (partly why I'm
specifically an *analogue* photographer) and I've found my mental health improved.
