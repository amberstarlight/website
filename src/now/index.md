Last update: {% niceDate page.date %}

This is a [now page][1], which I'll update to give you an overview of what I'm
doing _now_. Inspired by [Derek Sivers][2]!

## Recent Things, in no particular order

- I wrote [an article](/blog/articles-i-might-finish-someday/) about articles I
  haven't written yet.
- I got inked for the first time before trans pride 2024 (the word `euphoria`
  above my right knee).
- I haven't been very good at updating my website.
- I haven't had a working car for more than a week since August as he keeps
  breaking. :(
- I didn't focus more on photography because:
  - a friend was in hospital
  - I went to a funeral (not of the friend, they're ok now)
  - the summer weather was hit and miss
- Suffered from burnout because Life's A Lot Sometimes.
- Started therapy, which is really helpful at unpacking unhealthy thought
  patterns and processing trauma.

## Ideas to come back to next time

- I should split these kinds of personal updates away from a now page, so they
  can be catalogued and referred back to.
