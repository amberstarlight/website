## Interests

### Photography

I've recently picked up a medium format camera: a _Zenza Bronica
ETRSi_. It's a 6x4.5 (645) camera, taking 15 frames on a roll of 120 film. I
have the AE-III Prism Finder E and the Speed Grip E accessories, which makes
it feel a lot like using a big 35mm SLR with an autowinder. I haven't worked
out when my particular camera was made, but it has to be somewhen between 1988
and 2004.

I still have my Pentax MX (two of them, in fact), but they really could do with
a service. The X-sync isn't working right on either of them, and some of the
slower shutter speeds are hit and miss on the black MX.

### Media

I've been on a big movie kick recently. As it happens, big tech have decided
that they're going to make all the streaming services worse and split all the
content that used to just be on the biggest one (Netflix) across many different
ones. So take my advice and buy yourself Blu-Rays. Learn how to rip them.

Films I've really loved recently:

- **Heathers (1988)**
  - Christian Slater _and_ Winona Ryder in the _same film_!
- **The Usual Suspects (1995)**
  - I've seen it several times but I'll never tire of this one.
- **But I'm A Cheerleader (2000)**
  - A very beautiful film looking through the femme lesbian lens.

## Work

Still a _DevOps Engineer_ (my job title). If you have an opportunity, do send
me an email.
