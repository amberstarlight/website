Hey. I'm Amber, I'm {{ meta.authorAge }}, and I'm a software & operations engineer.

My pronouns are [she/her](https://en.pronouns.page/she).

I don't use social media; if you want to contact me, you can do so via [email][1].

I have a profile on some Git-as-a-Service platforms, which you can see here:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/amberstarlight)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/amberstarlight)

I am NOT on any Internet platforms not listed on this page. Anyone under the
username `amberstarlight` on those platforms is an impostor.
