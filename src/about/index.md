Hi! I'm Amber ([she/her](https://en.pronouns.page/she)), I'm
{{ meta.authorAge }}, and I'm a software & operations engineer by trade. You
may know this as the practice of DevOps. In my spare time, I'm an _everything
hobbyist_, weaving in and out of many different interests, including but not
limited to:

- cars (incl. sportscar racing, the modified scene, etc)
- computers, namely SFF Linux machines (I use Arch BTW)
- music, notably drum and bass, jungle, og dubstep, garage, 2step, etc.
- programming as a hobby
- mechanical keyboards (I write this on a self-designed 1-of-1 _Vision
  Computer Systems 750 GT_)
- film photography, 35mm and 645 medium format

If you're interested in what I output in a programming sense, I have a profile
on some Git-as-a-Service platforms, which you can see here:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/amberstarlight)
- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/amberstarlight)

As I work for a contractor, sometimes I am required to use VCS accounts that are
not my own, and this activity is not reflected in any gamification metrics you
see on these platforms.

If you want to contact me, you can do so via [email][1].

> Author's note: I am NOT on any Internet platforms not listed on this page.
> Anyone under the username `amberstarlight` on those platforms is an impostor.
